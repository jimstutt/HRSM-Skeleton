# Simple overlay that exposes local ghc-wasm-meta packages under pkgs.wasm
self: super: {
  wasm = super.callPackage ./ghc-wasm-meta-compat.nix {};
}

# Note: This is a tiny shim. If you want to import the full ghc-wasm-meta
# overlay from your local clone, create a proper overlay that imports
# ghc-wasm-meta/overlays/default.nix from your local repo. This file keeps
# things small and avoids many flake overlay errors.
